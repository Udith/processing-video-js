  This is an attempt at writing a JavaScript companion to an existing
  Java library, namely the Processing video library.
	
  One goal is to have video sketches run in JavaScript mode out of the 
  box. Another is to come up with a recommendation on how to write or
  wrap and package JavaScript libraries to make them available inside 
  Processing 2.0 JavaScript mode (powered by Processing.js).
	
  Note: Capture will currently not be implemented as it's not supported
  by browsers yet.
