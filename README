  This is an attempt at writing a JavaScript companion to an existing
  Java library, namely the Processing video library.
	
  One goal is to have video sketches run in JavaScript mode out of the 
  box. Another is to come up with a recommendation on how to write or
  wrap and package JavaScript libraries to make them available inside 
  Processing 2.0 JavaScript mode (powered by Processing.js).
	
  Note: Capture will currently not be implemented as it's not supported
  by browsers yet.

  Differences to the Java processing.video.Movie class

  - new Movie( <PApplet>sketch, <String>path ) 
    accepts multiple paths to support HTML5 formats:
    new Movie( this, "video.mp4", "video.webm", "video.ogv" )

  - Movie.speed() 
    does not accept a negative value (will stop)

  - Sources coming from remote locations (not same domain / port) will
    only work when CORS is set up correctly:
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTTP_access_control

  - Movie.pixels[]
    are read only at the moment, use Movie.get() to manipulate pixels

  - Movie.speed() 
    does not work in FireFox because of a Bug
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=495040

  - Movie.jump() 
    does only work in Chrome if your server is able to serve 
    "206 partial content" (check the response header of the video request)

  - Movie.setSourceFrameRate( <float>fps )
    HTML5 video does not have a way to report the fps of a video source,
    so you will have to set that yourself (default is 25.0). This value is 
    used for Movie.frameRate() and returned by Movie.getSourceFrameRate()

  - Movie.getElement()
    will return the DOM <video> element used to play the movie

  - Movie.getFilename()
    returns the source (if loaded) that is actually being played. It's a
    way to find out which of multiple sources (mp4/webm/ogv) has been loaded.

  - new Movie({ sources:<array> OR element: <DOM video>,
                listener:<object> 
                [, poster:<string>path] })
    for JavaScript only usage, Movie constructor also accepts an options object.
    sources   ["video.mp4", "video.ogv", ...]
    element   optional DOM video node, no need to provide sources then
    listener  {}, should implement movieEvent(Movie)
    poster    optional, path to an image to use as poster-frame
