-	Catch CORS exceptions, maybe do a OPTIONS request on video?

-	pixel[] manipulation is a pain to implement as one would need 
	to define getter, setter for each array slot. Or?

-   Capture via getUserMedia()

-	Find a way to get fps of video

x 	Inherit from PImage?
   	"public class Movie extends PImage implements PConstants { ... }"
   	(solved by implementing all public/needed PImage properties and methods)

x   Copy pixels[], return PImage for read()?
 	(same as above)

x   Handle movieEvent()? 
    How to pass current instance?
    (internal poller-loop will trigger movieEvent on the sketch)
